You have an array of floating point numbers averages which is initially empty. You are given an array nums of n integers where n is even.

You repeat the following procedure n / 2 times:

Remove the smallest element, minElement, and the largest element maxElement, from nums.
Add (minElement + maxElement) / 2 to averages.
Return the minimum element in averages.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [7,8,3,4,15,13,4,1]

Output: 5.5
